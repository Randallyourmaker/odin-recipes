    <h1>Russian Pelmeni</h1>
    <h2>Pelmeni are traditional Russian meat-filled dumplings.
        <br>Making pelmeni is favorite family pastime in the long 
        <br>winter months. These dumplings are a common convenience 
        <br>food - big batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried on demand.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <p>Dough:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Filling:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>18 ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1â€‰1/2 tablespoons ice-cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup;
                <br>add enough water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a bowl, add 
                <br>3 cups flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover 
                <br>with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.</li>
            <li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a 
                <br>bowl and mix filling thoroughly by hand or using a fork.
            </li>
            <li>Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured 
                <br>surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a 
                <br>wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to 
                <br>avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling on one side 
                <br>of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using 
                <br>fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. 
                <br>Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and 
                <br>filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking 
                <br>together.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches 
                <br>of frozen pelmeni into simmering water. Cook and stir until the meat is 
                <br>cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for an 
                <br>additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.
            </li>
        </ol>
