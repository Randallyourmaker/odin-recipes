    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat; 
            <br>add mushrooms and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            <br>Remove from heat to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread an even layer of tomato sauce onto the cut sides of each
            <br>roll. Sprinkle equal amounts of garlic and oregano
            <br>onto each roll. Place 2 salami slices side by side onto each
            <br>roll; top each with 2 slices ham. Divide red onion, mushrooms,
            <br>red pepper, olives, and basil between the 4 sandwiches and 
            <br>spread evenly atop the meats. Finish by topping with provolone
            <br>cheese and sandwiching roll halves around the fillings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook sandwiches on preheated panini press until there are dark brown
            <br>grill marks on the bread, the cheese is melted, and the center is warm,
            <br>about 5 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
